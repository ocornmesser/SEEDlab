# SEEDlab

the code in this folder is the code the raspberry pi uses to see the marker and then transmit the information regarding the markers location and orientation. It transmits a 4 index list, where the first index is a 1 or 0 representing a marker is seen, the second index is the distance to the marker, the third index is the angle to the marker in radians, and the fourth index is a 1 or 0 representing if the marker is to the left or right of the robot.

this code outlines how the group completed the angle detection portion of the demo. The cameraCalibration file shows the code for finding the camera matrix. The detectAruco file shows the code for using this matrix to find the angle to the aruco marker.

For the first task, the robot will be placed at a fixed point, and the a 5cm by 5cm marker will be placed at 5
different locations in front of the robot. The marker may be between 1 and 5 feet away from the robot. The
robot should indicate that it detects the marker in the LCD screen within 10 seconds, and also display the angle
to the marker away from the camera center.
